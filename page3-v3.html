						I am a third year Computer Engineering student currently studying at McGill University in QC, Canada, and I am currently seeking a Summer or Fall 2021 Internship. Key course work I am studying includes <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/ecse-331">Electronics</a>, <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-251">Algorithms and Data Structures</a>  and <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/courses/ecse-211">Design Principles and Methods</a>. I believe that learning is a continual, iterative process, and to excel one must always be ready to try, fail, (hopefully learn something!), and try again. When not working on assignments, I like to expand my knowledge of software tools and languages by working on fun projects. Some fun ones include this website to display information about me and two simple arcade games (Pong and Asteroids) programmed using Java and the ACM graphics library.

						Aside from my technical experience, I am a driven, out-going person, and I am always getting involved in groups such as student government. From November 2018 to November 2019, I served as a Member at Large on the <a href="https://wiki.mcgilleus.ca/Board_of_Governors">McGill EUS Board of Governors</a>. Working under the Board Chair as a team of society executives and directors, the McGill EUS Board of Governors is tasked with ensuring the legal and financial security of the society. I also served as the Year 1 Computer Representative for the Electrical, Computer and Software Engineering Student Society <a href="https://ecsess.mcgilleus.ca/">(ECSESS)</a>. This position is important to me because working at a departmental level, rather than overseeing the society, allows me work more closely with my peers in Computer Engineering here at McGill.

						Opportunities to work with groups such as the EUS are exciting to me because I have experienced the value that the EUS can bring to the lives of its members here at McGill, and I want to be apart of this. I have also begun to foster a interest in the governance aspect of the society after sitting on the Board of Governors as a Memeber at Large. Getting involved in the EUS has offered me the opportunity to collaborate with all the awesome people who do amazing for the EUS and it's members. These opportunities have been valuable for personal growth as well. For example, conflict inevitably arises when working with others and this has taught me that strong communication skills are necessary for effective collaboration.

						My past work experience includes 8 months at Starbucks Coffee Shop over the Summer of 2020 as a Barista. I had the opportunity there to work as part of a large team and to train new members of that team. In past I have also worked various summer jobs at resturants and similar. Before that I worked for just shy of two years at Choices Markets, a BC owned and operated grocery store where I had the opportunity to interact and provide customer service to customers as well as organize and stock the store.

						Outside of work and school, my interests and hobbies range from sports to music to coding. I am an avid Hockey and Ultimate Frisbee player and I enjoy all sorts of other team sports as well. I have also played piano for the past 8+ years achieving Grade 8 RCM standing and I also had the opportunity to be part of a band (Red Shift) for a while. Some of my other interests include video games and role-playing games, especially Civilization and D&D.

						I am currently studying Computer Engineering at McGill and I am just finishing up my second year and I am currently seeking a summer 2019 internship! Some classes I am taking include <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/courses/ecse-223">Model-Based Programming</a> and <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/courses/ecse-211">Design Principles and Methods</a> (two group project design courses) as well as Circuits and Signals classes that cover the hardware side of Comp Eng. I believe that learning is a continual, iterative process, and to excel one must always be ready to try, fail, (hopefully learn something!), and try again. When not working on assignments, I like to expand my knowledge of software tools and languages by working on fun projects. Some fun ones include recreating the MeowMeowBeenz app (from the NBC TV show Community) and two simple arcade games (Pong and Asteroids) programmed using Java and the ACM graphics library.

						Aside from my technical experience, I am a driven, out-going person, and I am always getting involved in groups such as student government. Currently I am sitting as a Member at Large on the <a href="https://wiki.mcgilleus.ca/Board_of_Governors">McGill EUS Board of Governors</a>. We are tasked with ensuring the legal and financial security of the society. I am also serving as the Year 1 Computer Representative for the Electrical, Computer and Software Engineering Student Society <a href="https://ecsess.mcgilleus.ca/">(ECSESS)</a>. This position is important to me because working at a departmental level, rather than overseeing the society, allowing me work more closely with my peers in Computer Engineering here at McGill.

						Opportunities to work with groups such as the EUS are exciting to me because I have experienced the value that the EUS can bring to the lives of its members here at McGill, and I want to be apart of this. I have also begun to foster a interest in the governance aspect of the society after sitting on the Board of Governors over these past months. Getting involved in the EUS has offered me the opportunity to collaborate with all the awesome people who do amazing for the EUS and it's members. These opportunities have been valuable for personal growth as well. For example, conflict inevitably arises when working with others and this has taught me that strong communication skills are necessary for effective collaboration.

						My past work experience includes 4 months at The Keg Steakhouse over the Summer of 2018 as a Busser and Food Runner. I had the opportunity there to work as part of a large team and to train new members of that team. Before that I worked for just shy of two years at Choices Markets, a BC owned and operated grocery store where I had the opportunity to interact and provide customer service to customers as well as organize and stock the store.

						Outside of work and school, my interests and hobbies range from sports to music to coding. I am an avid Hockey and Ultimate Frisbee player and I enjoy all sorts of other team sports as well. I have also played piano for the past 8+ years achieving Grade 8 RCM standing and more recently having the opportunity to be part of a band. Some of my other interests include video games and role-playing games, especially Civilization and D&D.
